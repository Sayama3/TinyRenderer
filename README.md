# Tiny Renderer

## Description

Tiny Renderer is a minimalistic application with minimalistic dependencies which is made with OpenGL with the goal of
simplifying the process of making simple 3D rendering application.

On this library, you can setup a application window, submit data for rendering (models, shaders, or directly use opengl commands)
draw the result on screens and that's about it.

You just need to know how to use the `UniformBuffer` to use a custom shader with the default camera. But see the Documentation
(once it's done) to know more about it.
